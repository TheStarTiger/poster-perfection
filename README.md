# Summer 2018 - Neural Network Poster Readability Optimization

Summer research by developing and testing a program that uses neural networks 
to categorize and correct academic research posters. Corrections are done to maximize 
readability and accessibility. 

Project was completed in Python, with the assistance of pptx and TensorFlow.

TensorPlay contains the main functions, Playgrounds contains the color-related functions, 
and PresentPlay contains various neural network and clustering functions.
